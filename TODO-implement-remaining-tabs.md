# Implement Remaining TeacherDashboard Tabs

## Issues to Fix:
1. Earnings tab is a placeholder - needs full implementation
2. Settings tab is a placeholder - needs full implementation

## Plan:
- Implement Earnings tab: Calculate and display earnings from course prices * enrollments
- Implement Settings tab: Form to update user profile (name, bio, phone)

## Files to Edit:
- client/src/pages/TeacherDashboard.jsx: Implement renderEarnings and renderSettings functions

## Backend Requirements:
- Earnings calculation: Use existing course data and enrolledStudents
- Settings update: Use existing /api/users PUT endpoint

## Followup:
- Test both tabs functionality
- Verify data persistence
